# Hi üëã

I'm James.

I'm the author of [ASP.NET Core 2 High Performance](https://unop.uk/book/) (second edition), a book about creating high performance web apps with C# and .NET Core (an open source and cross-platform framework from Microsoft - they are dropping the "Core" branding from .NET 5 onwards but it is the same open product).
The book is also a large collection of tips applicable to making web apps perform well in any language or framework, full-stack from hardware to frontend.

I mainly work with C#, .NET and JavaScript/TypeScript/React but also work regularly with Python (v3 but also v2).
I use Linux, Markdown, git, CI / testing automation and time-series databases (such as InfluxDB) almost daily too.

I maintain [Huxley2](https://github.com/jpsingleton/Huxley2), a cross-platform CORS enabled JSON ReST proxy for the GB railway Live Departure Boards SOAP API
  - .NET Core ReST JSON web API
  - SOAP XML API integration
  - Azure DevOps CI/CD (YAML) and Azure hosting

If you find my work valuable then please consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/jpsingleton). Thanksüï¥üèª
